web-vim-config
========

This is my personal Vim configuration. It's not the best vim configuration out there, it's made according to my preferences.

It'd  like to think it's a simple vim configuration (not bloated with useless plugins) and it's very good if you are a web developer who use python,django, ruby,  ruby on rails, javascript, html(haml), sass etc.

Feel free to fork and pull request if you want, or distribute it.
